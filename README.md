## This repository contains scripts and data for mutational analysis presented in "SARS-CoV-2 spatial dispersal and fast evolution in free-ranging white-tailed deer in Ohio" by McBride et al.

###Folders:

*data* contains description of obtained clusters, phylogenetic trees, and vcf files with reconstructed mutations

*data/Delta/Delta.clusters.snpeff.corrected.vcf* - corrected vcf file with mutations in Delta clusters

*data/Delta/Delta.singletons.spneff.vcf* - corrected vcf file with mutations in Delta singletons

*data/Delta/Delta.clusters.final.csv* contains information about Delta

*data/Alpha/Alpha.clusters.snpeff.corrected.vcf* - corrected vcf file with mutations in Alpha clusters

*data/Alpha/Alpha.clusters* contains information about Alpha clusters


###*scripts* contains scripts in order to reproduce the analysis
